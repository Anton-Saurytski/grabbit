We follow link:http://semver.org/[semantic versioning]. Installation of different major versions between machines are unsupported, and likely incompatible.

Active development is on the "master" branch. Security patches and the like are sometimes back-ported to prior versions.

Of course pull-requests are happily accepted for those that would like to submit things like back-porting features for AEM 5.6, etc.
